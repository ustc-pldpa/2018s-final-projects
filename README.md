The introduction and related materials should be stored in a **subdirectory** named `<your-team-no.>-<your-proj-name>` in root directory of this repository, and in the subdirectory there should be a markdown file named `README.md`  to introduce the project. The team number should be always two digits. The project name should be made up of lowercase characters, numbers and slashes.
